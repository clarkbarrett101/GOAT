## DEMO Presentation Plan
- Clark - Explain the goal of branding the product in different ways to appeal to different markets using targeted ads, explain focus group testing and polls for the UI and device case design.
- Juan - Explain the workflow for the UI of all the pages (Clark designs the wire frame, Juan converts Figma to CSS to React Native, Diego applies scaling functions so it fits on different screens).
- Diego - Explain the different pages and stylesheets, explains how the app works (how the graph shows the difference from the starting frame and how it automatically detects when a repeat occurs).
- Sam - Explains how the different states/settings and components link together.
- Pedro and Jeff - The store page
- Q&A
